## Trading Strategies

Jesse allows you to implement various trading strategies. Here are a few examples:

### 1. Moving Average Crossover

This strategy involves buying when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average and selling when the opposite occurs.

### 2. Mean Reversion

This strategy assumes that prices will revert to their mean. Buy when the price is below the mean and sell when it is above.

### 3. Momentum Trading

This strategy focuses on buying assets that are trending upwards and selling those that are trending downwards.

For a comprehensive guide on creating and implementing these strategies, please refer to the [documentation](docs).
